## About
This project contains some programs about Threads topics. I will be working with <b>Runnable interface</b> and <b>Thread class</b>. One important objective of this activity is detect differences between these two ways of working with threads.

### Genaral features about these tools
- They are all cointainend in <b>java.lang</b> package
## Stack
- Java 17.0.1
- eclipse IDE for Java Developers - 2021-12

## Results conclusions and observations
Through develop this little java project I was able to compare differences between working with <b>Thread class</b> and implementing <b>Runnable interface</b>.

  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Advantages</th>
    <th>Disadvantages</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extend Class</td>
    <td>It is easier to implement <br> There are some methods coded ready to use sucha setName and getName</td>
    <td>We miss Inheritance benefits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Runnable Interface</td>
    <td>We can save space for using Inheritance in future</td>
    <td>It is not as easy to use</td>
  </tr>

## Content
Here I describe what is kept on <b>/src</b> folder. Please feel free to clone this project and check this out on your computer. I worked with <em>packages</em> in this project in order to separate topics. The task requested on 2022-04-01 is in <b>/activityDone</b> package on this same project.
